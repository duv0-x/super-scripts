## 🧰 Super Scripts

This repository contains a collection of scripts and utilities I've developed or refined over time as part of my daily work for solving _**exceptional problems**_. They're tools that have helped me automate tasks, debug issues, and solve recurring problems — and I hope they can be useful to others as well.

### 📁 Repository Structure

Scripts are grouped by category or purpose. You’ll find:

- `aws/`: Scripts for AWS automation, housekeeping, querying, and more
- `devops/`: CI/CD helpers, deployment tools, and integration utilities
- `utils/`: General-purpose tools for everyday tasks
- `networking/`: Scripts related to networking tests, configs, or monitoring
- `infra/`: Infrastructure-related provisioning or helper tools
- `scripts/`: Miscellaneous scripts that don't fit other categories

> ⚠️ Some scripts may require additional tools, credentials, or environment variables. Please review each script before running it.

### 🎯 Purpose

This is a living repository. As I create or adapt new scripts that help streamline my workflow, I’ll continue to add them here.

If any of these tools save you time or help you solve a problem, feel free to let me know — and pull requests or suggestions are always welcome!
